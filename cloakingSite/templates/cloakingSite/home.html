    <h1>About this site</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this site is to showcase potential cloaking techniques. This site can be used to perform tests
        with honeyclients. It can also be used during presentations or trainings to increase awareness.</p>
    <p>This site was created by Jeroen Pinoy as part of Master thesis research, in scope of the Computer
        Science graduate programme at the Open University of the Netherlands (Open Universiteit Nederland). The research
        is supervised by assistant professor Dr. Ir. Hugo Jonker.</p>
    <p>For this demo site, the following images are used as good and bad content.</p>

    <h2>What is cloaking?</h2>
    <p>Website cloaking is a technique that enables websites to deliver different content to different clients, with the
        goal of hiding particular content from certain clients. Website cloaking is based on client detection, which is
        achieved via browser fingerprinting. In an attempt to hide their malicious web pages from detection, cyber
        criminals use cloaking. They use vulnerability detection to only target clients that seem vulnerable. On top of
        that, they also provide benign content in case they suspect someone or something is trying to detect them.</p>
    <p>Below we describe four different strategies that can be used to deliver web content. Note that all of the below
        strategies can be combined with a phased fingerprinting approach. Using such an approach, the different
        fingerprint checks are done in separate phases. The first server or script might check one fingerprintable
        attribute and then redirect to another page or server, or deliver another fingerprinting script. This could then
        check another fingerprintable attribute and do the same thing. The end result is that part of the cloaking stack
        is cloaked as well, making potential investigations harder.</p>
    <h2>No cloaking</h2>
    <p>With no cloaking, the delivered content does not depend on the browser fingerprint. As a result the same content
        is delivered to all visitors. The client submits a request for a page, the server sends the content without
        applying any filtering.</p>

         alt="Simple sequence diagram - no cloaking example">
    <h2>Server-side cloaking</h2>
    <p>In server-side cloaking, the cloaking logic is entirely on the server. The client submits a request to the
        server,
        the server uses some of the details of the request to determine whether it should send specific content or not.
        Examples of this type of cloaking are the blocking of certain IP addresses or User-Agent strings from seeing the
        cloaked content.</p>

         alt="Simple sequence diagram - server-side cloaking example">
    <h2>Client-side cloaking</h2>
    <p>In client-side cloaking, the cloaking logic is sent to the client and executed inside the browser client, for
        example by using JavaScript. An example of this is a script that checks if the user visited other pages before
        the requested one in this browser session (tab) or not, before requesting the cloaked content.</p>

         alt="Simple sequence diagram - client-side cloaking example">
    <h2>Client-side cloaking with server side validation of results</h2>
    <p>In this case, client-side technologies such as JavaScript are used to gather certain browser attributes, which
        are then sent back to the server. The server then uses that data to decide whether it should sent the cloaked
        content or not.</p>
